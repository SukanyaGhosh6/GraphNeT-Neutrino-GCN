# GraphNeT: Neutrino Event Reconstruction with Graph Neural Networks

## 1. Introduction

Neutrino astronomy aims to explore astrophysical phenomena using neutrinos, which interact weakly with matter. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle with sparse, high-dimensional detector data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful approach to modeling such data as graphs for better inference.

## 2. Proposed Methodology

We propose a GNN architecture built with PyTorch Geometric to interpret the spatial and temporal hit data recorded by neutrino detectors. Each event is modeled as a graph, where nodes represent hits and edges encode spatial/temporal proximity.

## 3. Feasibility Study

Prior research ([Kravitz et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12194)) confirms that GNNs can outperform classical methods. Computational feasibility is ensured by batching graphs and using GPU-accelerated message passing.

## 4. Model Description

Our model consists of:

* Graph Convolutional Layers (GCNs)
* Global pooling to extract graph-level features
* Fully connected layers to output reconstructed quantities (energy, direction)

## 5. Working Principle

GNNs propagate information between neighboring nodes using message-passing. Over multiple layers, the network learns to extract global properties of the graph, allowing the model to infer physical attributes from sparse hits.

## 6. Methodology

* **Preprocessing**: Convert detector hits into graph format
* **Training**: Use regression loss (MSE) to train energy/direction outputs
* **Validation**: Compare predicted vs. true event parameters

## 7. Algorithm

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        x, edge_index = batch.x, batch.edge_index
        out = model(x, edge_index)
        loss = criterion(out, batch.y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## 8. Dataset Acquisition

We use the [IceCube Open Data](https://icecube.wisc.edu/data-releases) which provides realistic event simulations including coordinates, times, and energy labels for neutrino hits.

## 9. Architecture

* Input: Node features (time, charge, position)
* 3 GCN Layers (ReLU + BatchNorm)
* Global mean pooling
* 2 Dense Layers with Dropout
* Output: 3D direction unit vector + energy scalar

## 10. Experimentation

Experiments were conducted on Google Colab Pro with CUDA support. Batch size and learning rates were varied. Ablation studies were performed by disabling certain node features.

## 11. Dataset Annotation

Events are labeled with ground truth energy and direction from simulation metadata. Noise hits are filtered using a threshold on time window and signal-to-noise ratio.

## 12. Performance Criteria

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for energy prediction
* **Cosine Similarity** for direction
* **Inference Speed** (ms/event)
